We're are incredibly proud to announce—the Serverless Framework has been chosen as an EMA top 3 for serverless technologies!

EMA chose Serverless for its top 3 because of its simple deployments, rapid community adoption, and seamless developer experience. They specifically highlight the ways the Serverless Framework addresses common pain points in serverless development, via:

- Continuous compliance and security
- Consistency between dev, test, and production
- Significant reduction in complexity
- Ease of onboarding new developers into serverless development

EMA believes that the Serverless Framework is a great fit for enterprises who want to move forward quickly, easily, and safely with serverless. If you have more serverless research to do, EMA also just launched a website, [The EMA Top 3 for Serverless Technologies](https://www.ematop3.com/serverless.html), which contains adoption and job metrics, as well as aggregated Serverless news and other data. It’s well worth checking out.

We are humbled by our community and the support you provide; we wouldn’t be here without you. Here’s to a great start in 2019!
